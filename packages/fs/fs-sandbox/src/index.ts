/**
 * `SandboxedFileSystem`: the sandbox-enforcing implementation of the
 * `coding-fs` Service Definition. It extends `LocalFileSystem` so all
 * text-storage mechanics — resolve, stat, read/stream, list, the atomic
 * write and the read-match-write edit critical section — are the local
 * implementation's, verbatim; this package adds only the per-call POLICY fence
 * on the two mutations. Reads pass through untouched: every mode permits
 * reading.
 *
 * The fence is a policy check in TRUSTED code over a MODEL-CONTROLLED path,
 * NOT a kernel boundary — the operations are the seam's own (open, rename),
 * and only the target path is untrusted, so canonicalize-then-contain is the
 * complete answer to this surface. Kernel-grade isolation of untrusted CODE
 * stays `ctx.shell`'s job (`coding-bash-sandbox`). This mirrors the
 * `code-runtime` stance: containment, not a security boundary. The residual
 * TOCTOU (an ancestor symlink swapped between the containment re-check and the
 * syscall) is narrowed by re-canonicalizing immediately before delegating and
 * is accepted for this threat model.
 *
 * Per-call policy: `read-only` denies every mutation; `workspace-write` allows
 * a mutation only when the target canonicalizes under the policy's workspace
 * root or a platform temp area (the SAME writable-root set Seatbelt grants,
 * derived from the one `writableRoots` function so bash and fs cannot drift);
 * `danger-full-access` delegates unfenced. A denial throws the structured
 * `FS_SANDBOX_DENIED` — no text inference is needed (unlike bash's kernel
 * stderr), because an in-process fence knows exactly what it refused. The
 * escalation retry lives in the tool layer (`coding-tool-fs`),
 * exactly as bash's does.
 *
